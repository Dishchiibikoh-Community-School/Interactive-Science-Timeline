                    <h3>The Dawn of Technology</h3>
                    <p>The creation of the first stone tools by early hominins represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in human evolution. These simple yet revolutionary implements were crafted by Homo habilis, often called "handy man" for this very reason.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>The earliest known stone tools, called Oldowan tools, were made by striking one stone against another to create sharp edges. These tools included choppers, scrapers, and cutting implements that were used for processing meat, cracking bones for marrow, and preparing plant materials.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Archaeological Evidence</h3>
                    <p>The oldest known stone tools were discovered in Ethiopia and Kenya, dating back approximately 2.6 million years. Sites like Gona in Ethiopia and Lomekwi 3 in Kenya have provided crucial evidence of early tool use.</p>

                impact: 'This innovation marked the beginning of human technology and gave our ancestors a crucial advantage in survival. Tool use led to improved nutrition through better food processing, which likely contributed to brain development and the eventual emergence of more sophisticated human species.'

                    <h3>Archaeological Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Evidence of controlled fire use has been found at sites like Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (1 million years ago) and Qesem Cave in Israel (400,000 years ago). These sites show hearths, burned bones, and tools heated in fires.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Multiple Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Fire provided warmth in cold climates, protection from predators, light for extended activities, and most importantly, the ability to cook food. Cooking made nutrients more available and reduced the energy needed for digestion.</p>

Some scientists believe cooking was essential for the evolution of our large brains.'

                    <h3>Global Emergence</h3>
                    <p>Agriculture emerged in the Fertile Crescent (wheat, barley), China (rice, millet), Mesoamerica (maize, beans, squash), the Andes (potatoes, quinoa), Eastern North America (sunflower, squash), sub-Saharan Africa (yams, sorghum), and New Guinea (bananas, taro).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Domestication Process</h3>
                    <p>Humans selectively bred wild plants and animals, gradually creating domestic species with traits beneficial for farming. This process took thousands of years and involved genetic changes in both crops and livestock.</p>

                    <h3>Major Contributions</h3>
                    <p>The Babylonians created the first star catalogs and developed mathematical astronomy. Egyptians built pyramids aligned with stars and created a 365-day calendar. Mayans developed incredibly accurate calendars and predicted eclipses.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Practical Applications</h3>

                    <p>Andreas Vesalius revolutionized medical education and practice by conducting detailed dissections of human cadavers and documenting his findings with unprecedented accuracy in "De Humani Corporis Fabrica" (On the Structure of the Human Body).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Challenging Galen</h3>
                    <p>Vesalius corrected over 200 errors in the anatomical works of Galen, the ancient Greek physician whose writings had been accepted as medical truth for over 1,000 years. He proved that Galen had based many observations on animal dissections rather than humans.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Detailed Illustrations</h3>
                    <p>The work featured incredibly detailed and accurate anatomical illustrations, setting a new standard for medical texts and making complex anatomical knowledge accessible to medical students and physicians.</p>

                    <p>Galileo discovered four moons of Jupiter (now called Galilean moons), observed the phases of Venus, saw craters and mountains on Earth's Moon, and discovered that the Milky Way consisted of countless individual stars.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scientific Method</h3>
                    <p>Galileo combined careful observation with mathematical analysis, establishing principles of the scientific method. He recorded his observations systematically and used them to test theoretical predictions.</p>
